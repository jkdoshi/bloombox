Bloombox is a configuration-driven business application container. It provides several facilities that are essential to business applications, such as:

  * UI
    * Visual Components
    * Internationalization
    * UI-to-Data binding

  * Persistence
    * ORM
    * Transaction Management
    * Record-level access control

  * Security

  * Business Logic
    * Validation
    * Triggers
    * Rules

The business application is defined by a collection of XML files, and if necessary, code libraries in case advanced functionality is needed. These XML files define UI, data entities etc. The application is also backed by a database that contains configuration as well as application data.
